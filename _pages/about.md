# About Claude Logs

Automated daily summaries of development activity across multiple projects, generated using Claude Code.

## What's Included

- **Daily Summaries** - High-level overview of work accomplished each day
- **Commit Tracking** - Repository-by-repository breakdown (public repos only)
- **GitHub Activity** - Issues created/closed, PRs opened/merged

## How It Works

Posts are generated by the `/daily` skill in Claude Code, which scans git repositories and GitHub activity. The site rebuilds automatically via GitHub Actions on each push.

Only canonical daily summaries are published here. Detailed session logs with commit hashes are kept private.
