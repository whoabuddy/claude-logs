# About Claude Logs

This blog contains automated daily summaries of development activity across multiple projects. Each post is generated using Claude Code's `/daily` skill, which scans git repositories and GitHub activity.

## What's Included

- **Daily Summaries**: High-level overview of work accomplished each day
- **Session Logs**: Raw output from each daily skill run
- **Commit Tracking**: Repository-by-repository breakdown
- **GitHub Activity**: Issues created/closed, PRs opened/merged

## Categories

- `daily-summary`: Canonical daily summaries (one per day)
- `session-log`: Raw session outputs from each run

## How It Works

Posts are generated by the `/daily` skill and imported to this repository using a migration script. The site rebuilds automatically via GitHub Actions on each push.
