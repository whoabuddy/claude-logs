## Highlights

Built out the x402Stacks payment infrastructure across three repos: API host with OpenRouter proxy and x402 payment verification, sponsor relay for gasless transactions, and upstream contributions to coinbase/x402. Major improvements to claude-knowledge: renamed ralph to sprout-docs, updated daily skill with GitHub Events API, added shared CLAUDE.md reference and setup skill for team onboarding. Created homebase MVP (private). Updated daily summary format with At a Glance table across all historical logs.
