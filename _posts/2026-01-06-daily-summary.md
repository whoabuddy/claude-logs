# Daily Summary: 2026-01-06

**5 projects | 52 commits | 4 issues created | 5 issues closed**

## What I Worked On
- Built an interactive developer toolbox with wallet integration for the STX 402 API documentation site
- Added comprehensive testing and email contact forms for Thunder Mountain Builders client website
- Created documentation for smart contract testing tools and set up GitHub Pages doc sites
- Improved the automated issue handling system with better AI response parsing
- Built a daily summary skill for Claude Code to track work across all projects

## Projects Touched
- **stx402** (30 commits) - API docs site with new toolbox, wallet login, and compression endpoints
- **thundermountainbuilders** (8 commits) - Client website ready for launch with 105 tests
- **claude-knowledge** (6 commits) - Personal knowledge base with testing and GitHub Pages docs
- **schism** (5 commits) - Development automation with smarter issue routing
- **wallet-id-card** (3 commits) - Added GitHub Pages documentation

## Claude Code Setup (`.claude/`)
- **CLAUDE.md** - Added Clarity testing quick reference and git workflow conventions
- **commands/daily.md** - NEW: `/daily` command for generating work summaries
- **skills/daily/** - NEW: Bash script that scans all repos for commits, schism-dev agent activity, and GitHub issues/PRs
- **commands/ralph-write-docs.md** - Updated documentation generation command

## GitHub Activity
Created 4 issues for schism project planning; closed 5 issues including CI/CD setup and agent profiles.

## Progress Made
Heavy documentation and tooling day. The STX 402 site now has a unified navigation and interactive toolbox. Thunder Mountain Builders is production-ready. Documented the Clarity testing toolkit and created a daily summary skill that pulls git commits, GitHub issues/PRs, and agent activity into one report.
