# Daily Summary - 2026-01-07

> Last updated: 2026-01-07T09:39-07:00

## Highlights

We focused heavily on documentation infrastructure today, rolling out GitHub Pages with just-the-docs theme across multiple repositories. We also built automation tooling for batch documentation updates and added a structured logging system to our Cloudflare Workers API. On the schism project, we refactored from the Quest loop to a new Observe loop architecture with hourly status reporting.
