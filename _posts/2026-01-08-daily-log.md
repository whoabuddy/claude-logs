**40 commits** across **13 repos** (Pacific Time)

A full day building the x402 ecosystem: fixed critical API failures, launched a business development program with 13 partner sites, contributed wallet intelligence to the upstream stx402 repo, shipped a civic app for pothole reporting, and expanded the product lineup to 19 endpoints.

<!--more-->

## Why This Work Matters

The x402 protocol enables AI agents to pay for API access using cryptocurrency. Today's work expanded the ecosystem in three directions:

1. **Reliability** - Fixed price APIs that were silently failing, ensuring endpoints actually work when agents call them
2. **Adoption** - Created infrastructure to onboard partners who can earn revenue from x402
3. **Utility** - Added new endpoints that provide genuine value (wallet analysis, jobs board, alpha signals)

## Detailed Work Log

### Pothole Reporter v2 (00:50 - 01:28)

**What**: A mobile-first web app for reporting potholes to LA City services, specifically for the Bel Air neighborhood.

**Why it matters**: This is a real civic utility. Residents can photograph a pothole, the app captures GPS coordinates, and it emails the city with all details needed to dispatch repairs. Solves a genuine local problem.

**Work done**:
- `00:50` Launched Fix My Street v2.0 with complete rewrite
- `00:57` Configured test email for debugging delivery issues
- `01:04` Enhanced reports to include photo links and full street addresses (city needs this for dispatch)
- `01:11` Made GPS capture foolproof with better UX
- `01:14` Added graceful handling when GPS fails (common on mobile)
- `01:28` Built a beautiful help screen explaining how to enable location services

### sBTC DeFi Intelligence API (08:20)

**What**: An x402-paid API providing DeFi intelligence for sBTC (Bitcoin on Stacks).

**Why it matters**: sBTC is launching soon and will enable Bitcoin in DeFi. This API helps traders and agents simulate positions, assess risks, and find alpha opportunities. Provides the data layer that DeFi participants need to make informed decisions.

**Work done**:
- `08:20` Shipped complete API with position simulation, agent intelligence endpoints, and alpha signal detection

### pbtc21.dev Landing Page (08:27, 13:45)

**What**: The main hub showcasing all products in the ecosystem.

**Why it matters**: A central discovery point is essential as the product count grows. This is where visitors land to understand what's available and navigate to specific tools.

**Work done**:
- `08:27` Launched initial landing page as the main hub
- `13:45` Major expansion: added 6 more product cards (now 11 total), updated stats to reflect 19 products across 42 custom domains

**Live at**: [pbtc21.dev](https://pbtc21.dev)

### x402 Endpoint Tracker (08:15 - 13:20)

**What**: Internal documentation tracking all deployed workers, domains, and their status.

**Why it matters**: With 27 workers and 42 domains, tracking becomes essential. This README serves as the source of truth for what's deployed and where, preventing drift and enabling quick reference during development.

**Work done**:
- `08:15` Created initial tracker documenting all 17 endpoints
- `08:21` Added sbtc-defi-intel to GitHub tracking
- `08:28` Added coin-refill and pbtc21-landing (15/17 on GitHub)
- `08:33` Registered 8 more endpoints on the x402 registry
- `10:10` Added stx402-jobs (18 total endpoints)
- `10:20` Added jobs.pbtc21.dev custom domain
- `10:50` Confirmed all 18 endpoints have custom domains
- `11:49` Added x402-partners portal (19 total)
- `13:20` Final update: 27 workers, 42 domains, 13 partner sites

### stx402-alpha - Alpha Intelligence API (08:48, 09:17)

**What**: A premium x402 endpoint that aggregates multiple data sources and synthesizes them into actionable trading intelligence.

**Why it matters**: This is a "meta-endpoint" - it calls other endpoints internally and adds AI synthesis on top. The value proposition is one payment for a comprehensive market picture, rather than making 5+ separate API calls.

**Work done**:
- `08:48` Shipped production pricing and a polished frontend UI explaining what the endpoint provides
- `09:17` **Critical fix**: Binance and CryptoCompare APIs were blocking requests, causing silent failures. Replaced with KuCoin and CoinPaprika as fallback sources. This fix restored price data reliability.

**Live at**: [alpha.pbtc21.dev](https://alpha.pbtc21.dev)

---

### stx402-endpoint - Core x402 API (10:39)

**What**: The main stx402 endpoint providing prices, sentiment, oracle data, and more.

**Why it matters**: This is the foundational API that other endpoints depend on. When its price feeds fail, downstream services also fail.

**Work done**:
- `10:39` **Critical fix**: Same API blocking issue as stx402-alpha. Replaced Binance/CryptoCompare with KuCoin/CoinPaprika. This restored reliability for the core endpoint that other services depend on.

**Live at**: [x402.pbtc21.dev](https://x402.pbtc21.dev)

---

### STX402 Jobs Board (10:10, 10:20)

**What**: A jobs marketplace connecting humans with AI agents that need help.

**Why it matters**: AI agents are increasingly capable but still need human assistance for certain tasks (verification, physical actions, judgment calls). This creates economic opportunity at the intersection of human and AI labor. The tagline "Humans Helping Agents Build the Future" captures the vision.

**Work done**:
- `10:10` Launched the jobs board with full functionality
- `10:20` Fixed D1 database persistence (jobs weren't saving) and improved frontend error handling

**Live at**: [jobs.pbtc21.dev](https://jobs.pbtc21.dev)

### x402 Partner Portal (11:48, 12:00)

**What**: A dashboard where potential partners can explore x402 revenue opportunities.

**Why it matters**: Adoption requires showing partners the business case. This portal presents projected earnings, integration steps, and the value proposition in one place. It's the "sales deck" for x402 partnerships.

**Work done**:
- `11:48` Built complete portal with earnings tracking projections
- `12:00` Focused content on 13 priority partnership targets across AI, security, and infrastructure sectors

**Live at**: [partners.pbtc21.dev](https://partners.pbtc21.dev)

### x402 Partner Landing Sites (12:16, 13:05, 13:15)

**What**: 13 custom-branded landing pages, one for each target partner.

**Why it matters**: Generic outreach gets ignored. These pages are personalized - each shows a specific partner how x402 fits their product, with realistic revenue projections based on their user base. The 100% revenue model (no rev share) removes the main objection to platform partnerships.

**Partners with dedicated pages**:
- **AI Tier**: HeyElsa, Daydreams, Heurist - AI assistants that could monetize their APIs
- **Security**: Lit Protocol - decentralized access control could charge per operation
- **Infrastructure**: Phala, ChainSafe, Audius, Livepeer, Akash, Render, Fleek, Nodepay, Saturn - all provide infrastructure that agents need

**Work done**:
- `12:16` Created 13 custom partner landing pages
- `13:05` **Key decision**: Changed from 10% rev share to 100% revenue for partners. Partners keep everything. This removes friction and makes the pitch simpler.
- `13:15` Fixed infrastructure: 10 of 13 sites were missing DNS records and worker routes. Added all AAAA records (100:: proxied) and configured routes. All 13 now live.

**Live at**: `*.pbtc21.dev` (e.g., [heyelsa.pbtc21.dev](https://heyelsa.pbtc21.dev), [phala.pbtc21.dev](https://phala.pbtc21.dev))

### PR #18 to whoabuddy/stx402 (00:00 - 12:53)

**What**: Contributed two new wallet intelligence endpoints to the upstream stx402 repository.

**Why it matters**: Rather than keeping useful endpoints private, contributing them back grows the ecosystem. These endpoints help any wallet app or agent understand a user's portfolio. PR #18 is focused and reviewable (learned from PR #16 feedback to keep PRs small).

**Endpoints added**:
- `/api/wallet/analyze/:address` - Full intelligence report:
  - USD values via CoinGecko real-time prices
  - Risk score (0-100) based on concentration and exposure
  - Token categorization (DeFi, NFT, Governance, STX20)
  - Actionable insights ("High concentration in single token")

- `/api/wallet/quick/:address` - Fast summary:
  - STX balance with USD value
  - Top 5 holdings
  - Token and NFT counts

**Work done**:
- `00:00` Initial wallet intelligence endpoints
- `00:04` Added ERC-8004 agent intelligence endpoints
- `00:13` Added sBTC agent endpoints for AI treasury management
- `12:53` Submitted PR #18 with clean, focused wallet endpoints

**PR**: [github.com/whoabuddy/stx402/pull/18](https://github.com/whoabuddy/stx402/pull/18) - Awaiting review

## Key Decisions Made Today

1. **100% revenue to partners** - No rev share. Partners keep all earnings. Simpler pitch, removes objections.

2. **Replace blocked APIs proactively** - Binance and CryptoCompare blocking taught us to have fallbacks. Now using KuCoin and CoinPaprika.

3. **Small, focused PRs** - PR #16 feedback said to split up. PR #18 is just wallet endpoints. Easier to review.

4. **All endpoints get custom domains** - Consistency matters. Every endpoint lives at a memorable `*.pbtc21.dev` URL.
