**40 commits** across **13 repos** (Pacific Time)

A massive day of building the x402 ecosystem - from fixing APIs to launching a full business development program with 13 partner landing pages.

<!--more-->

## Major Accomplishments

### 1. x402 Partner Business Development Program

Built a complete partner outreach system for x402 adoption:

- **Partner Portal** ([partners.pbtc21.dev](https://partners.pbtc21.dev)) - A dashboard where potential partners can explore revenue opportunities
- **13 Custom Landing Pages** - Each partner gets their own branded page showing how x402 benefits them:
  - AI: HeyElsa, Daydreams, Heurist
  - Security: Lit Protocol
  - Infrastructure: Phala, ChainSafe, Audius, Livepeer, Akash, Render, Fleek, Nodepay, Saturn
- **100% Revenue Model** - Partners keep all revenue from their x402 endpoints (no rev share)

All sites configured with DNS records, worker routes, and live on `*.pbtc21.dev` subdomains.

### 2. PR #18 to whoabuddy/stx402

Submitted wallet intelligence endpoints for review:

- `/api/wallet/analyze/:address` - Full intelligence report with USD values, risk scoring (0-100), DeFi protocol detection, and actionable insights
- `/api/wallet/quick/:address` - Fast portfolio summary with top 5 holdings and counts

Uses CoinGecko for real-time prices, categorizes tokens (DeFi/NFT/Governance/STX20), and generates risk assessments based on portfolio concentration and exposure patterns.

### 3. Fixed Broken Price APIs

Both `stx402-endpoint` and `stx402-alpha` had failing price feeds because Binance and CryptoCompare blocked requests:

- Replaced with KuCoin and CoinPaprika as fallback sources
- Multi-source aggregation continues working

### 4. STX402 Jobs Board

Launched [jobs.pbtc21.dev](https://jobs.pbtc21.dev) - a jobs board for humans helping AI agents:

- D1 database persistence for job listings
- Fixed frontend error handling
- Theme: "Humans Helping Agents Build the Future"

### 5. Landing Page Updates

Updated [pbtc21.dev](https://pbtc21.dev) to showcase the growing ecosystem:

- Now shows 11 product cards (was 5)
- Stats updated: 19 products, 42 custom domains
- Added: Alpha Intelligence, Agent Registry, Jobs, Partner Portal, Endpoint Showcase
